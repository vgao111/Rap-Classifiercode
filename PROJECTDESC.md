# Rap-Classifiercode
rap or not???? like its that simple right????!!!

This classifier is rather incomplete. Although it has roughly 80% accuracy, it could be improved by including more training data, perferably half and half from non rap and rap. 
Additionally, a major concern is overfitting. I believe the model may be at its maximum capacity. I have noticed that the accuracy started to decline a little. 
The accuracy is inconsistent, it goes up and down, so maybe overfitting is an issue.
